Accessibility and semantics:
- Semantic HTML5 elements used (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- Proper headings (single h1 per page).
- Alt text for all images.
- Meta descriptions added.

Interactions and animations:
- All interactive elements (links, buttons, cards) include Tailwind transition utilities (transition-all duration-300 etc.).
- Body fades in on load.
- Sections reveal on scroll via IntersectionObserver.
- Buttons and links have hover effects, with a squishy/scale animation on hover where applicable.

Notes:
- Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN for this build.
- Hero uses a full-viewport background image with a dark overlay to ensure contrast.
- The header is transparent over the hero and becomes solid as the user scrolls.
- The mobile navigation uses a hamburger toggle with a playful animation.
